I am a Ph.D. student with the Embodied Learning and Intelligence for eXploration and Innovative soft Robotics (ELIXIR) Lab at Toronto Metropolitan University. My research is at the intesection of robotics (perception/control), cognitive science, machine learning, and differential geometric methods. I am working on aspects of emboddied intelligence for soft slender robotic systems.
